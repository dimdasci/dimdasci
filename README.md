# Intro

Hi, I'm an AI/ML Engineer with product leadership experience. Hands-on builder and team leader.

## About These Repositories
Personal explorations and tools built outside of work. While my professional experience includes enterprise-scale systems and complex data architectures, these repos demonstrate my coding approach, technical interests, and commitment to continuous learning.

## Current Focus
- 🤖 LLMs & RAG Systems - Implementation, evaluation, and reproducibility
- 📄 PDF Processing & Document Intelligence
- 🛠️ AI Coding Tools - Cursor, Copilot, and workflow automation
- 🔍 Search & Data - Graph databases, hybrid search, OpenSearch, Bleve
- ☁️ Cloud Architecture (AWS) & CI/CD automation
- 🐍 Python, Go, Rust

## Selected Projects

### Tools & Applications
- [quicksight-sync](https://github.com/dimdasci/quicksight-sync) - AWS QuickSight migration toolkit (CDK-based)
- [askweb](https://github.com/dimdasci/askweb) / [seek](https://github.com/dimdasci/seek) - LLM agentic workflows (Python prototype → Go for distribution)
